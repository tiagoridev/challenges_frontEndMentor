## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge ⚔️

    My challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    My users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Select and submit a number rating
    - See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
